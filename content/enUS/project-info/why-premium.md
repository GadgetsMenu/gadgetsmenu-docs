GadgetsMenu has been developed for more than 5 years since the first release in 2015. It takes time and effort to develop a cosmetics plugin to offers the features that you wanted, especially to guarantee a decent compatibility with every version from 1.8 to the latest version and will add further support when Minecraft releases new version. 

Tons of the features & cosmetics has been added in our plugin till now. We spend hours per day to develop new features to benefit you. 

Therefore, in order to maintain our daily expenses we need to turn into Premium to provide better features. For our premium buyers, you're able to download the latest version of GadgetsMenu which is GadgetsMenu [Premium]. Support only provided for the user who bought the plugin.
