Pet system has been redesigned with adding more features to make the pet become more functional. You can feed your pet with pet items to increase their attribute level and make them Happier. You will be able to ride your pet to go everywhere, set a special name for your every pet.

Pet attribute level will decrease by **1** every **5 minutes** no matter it's moving or sleeping. You can increase your pet's attribute by feeding them with food, drinking water or playing with toys. You can gain pet items by opening Mystery Boxes. You will receive random pet items once you open a Mystery Box. Every pet has their favourite, most liked or disliked item. When they ate their favourite food, their attribute level will increase even more than normal.
